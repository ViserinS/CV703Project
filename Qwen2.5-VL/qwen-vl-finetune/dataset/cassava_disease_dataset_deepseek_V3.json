The leaves also show noticeable curling and distortion, with edges appearing crinkled or twisted rather than smooth.

However, I can provide the diagnostic framework I would use if examining a case of Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB):\n\nFor a definitive CBB diagnosis, I would look for: 1) Angular leaf spots with sharp edges that follow leaf vein patterns (dark brown centers with yellowish halos), 2) A characteristic progression where spots merge into large necrotic patches while maintaining angular shapes, 3) Blackened veins extending beyond lesions (vascular streaking), and 4) Advanced cases showing leaf curling and dieback with a distinctive dry, papery texture in affected areas. The spots typically appear more geometric than fungal lesions, without powdery or fuzzy growth.\n\nBased on these standard CBB symptoms, if your plant shows: angular brown lesions with yellow borders, vein blackening, and dry papery deterioration without fungal structures, the diagnosis would be Cassava Bacterial Blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis. This would distinguish it from similar-looking conditions like Cassava Mosaic Virus (which causes yellow patterning without necrosis) or fungal diseases like Anthracnose (which produces more circular spots with concentric rings)."

No necrotic spots or dry, brittle edges are present, ruling out fungal or bacterial infections.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:**  \nBased on the clear mosaic patterning, leaf distortion, and absence of necrotic symptoms, this cassava plant is infected with **Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)**, caused by *Cassava mosaic viruses* (e.g., *African cassava mosaic virus* or *East African cassava mosaic virus*). The visual symptoms are classic for CMD and distinguish it from nutrient deficiencies or other pathogens."

The veins may appear darkened or streaked with brown-black discoloration, and severely affected leaves develop a dry, papery texture with cracked surfaces.

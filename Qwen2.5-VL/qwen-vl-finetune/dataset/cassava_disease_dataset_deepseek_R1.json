If the plant shows irregular patches of light and dark green on the leaves (mosaic pattern), with some areas appearing as yellow-green mottling, this would indicate CMD. The leaves might also appear distorted, curled, or stunted, with a rough, uneven texture where the mosaic discoloration occurs. The contrast between the dark green and chlorotic (yellowed) areas is typically sharp and irregular, creating a \"patchwork\" appearance. Younger leaves often show more severe deformation than older ones.\n\nThe described symptoms are definitive for Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), caused by begomoviruses in the family Geminiviridae. The mosaic patterning, leaf distortion, and color contrast are pathognomonic for this viral infection, which is one of the most destructive diseases of cassava worldwide. If these features are present in the image, the diagnosis is Cassava Mosaic Disease."

If this were the disease present, you would likely observe the following concrete features:  \n\n1. **Leaf Spots** – Dark brown to black angular spots with sharp edges, often confined by leaf veins, giving them a blocky or geometric appearance.  \n2. **Yellow Halos** – A distinct yellowish border surrounding the dark lesions, creating a noticeable contrast.  \n3. **Vein Discoloration** – Brown or black streaks running along leaf veins, sometimes causing wilting or curling.  \n4. **Dry, Papery Texture** – Affected areas become brittle and may crack or tear easily, resembling old parchment.  \n5. **Oozing & Gumming** – In severe cases, sticky bacterial exudate may dry into white or yellowish crusts on leaves or stems.  \n\n**Final Diagnosis:** Based on these classic symptoms, the disease is **Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)** (*Xanthomonas axonopodis* pv. *manihotis*). The combination of angular brown-black leaf spots, yellow margins, vein-associated necrosis, and dry, brittle texture confirms this bacterial infection. Immediate management (e.g., removing infected plants, using disease-free cuttings, and copper-based sprays) is recommended to prevent spread.  \n\n*(If you provide a detailed image description, I can refine the diagnosis further.)*"

Along the veins, there are elongated brown-to-black streaks, suggesting bacterial spread through the vascular system.

This characteristic mosaic pattern is highly pronounced, with patches of yellow-green tissue interspersed with normal dark green areas, creating a blotchy appearance. Several leaves show distortion and mild curling, particularly evident in the leaf margins that appear slightly twisted. The leaves have an uneven, asymmetrical shape compared to healthy cassava leaves, which would typically have a uniform green coloration. The reddish-purple stems (petioles) appear normal, but the contrast between the variegated leaf tissue is striking. The irregular distribution of chlorotic (yellowed) areas across the leaf blade without any defined borders or lesions is particularly noteworthy.\n\nThis cassava plant is infected with Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), caused by cassava mosaic geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus). The diagnostic features visible in the image - the irregular yellow-green and dark green mosaic pattern, leaf distortion, and mild curling - are classic symptoms of this viral disease. CMD is one of the most economically important diseases of cassava in Africa and parts of Asia, transmitted primarily by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and through the use of infected planting material. The severity of symptoms shown in this plant suggests a relatively advanced infection that is likely causing significant reduction in photosynthetic capacity and will ultimately result in reduced tuberous root yield."
